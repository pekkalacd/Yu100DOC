# Yu100DOC
repository for angela yu's 100 days of code

## About 

This repo contains my solutions for the projects from angela yu's course. special emphasis on *projects*, it does not include the "interactive coding exercises" as seen throughout the course.

### Additional Features

Start at day11-20, I implement unit tests for the code using the `unittest` module in python. This is subject to change to maybe `pytest` or `selenium` in the future. But we'll see.
