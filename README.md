# Yu100DOC
repository for angela yu's 100 days of code

## About 

This repo contains my solutions to the projects explored in angela yu's 100 days of code. Not all of the projects were completed, namely those such as the day6 and day7 projects nor those using certain modules such as turtle. But other than that, pretty much all of them will be here. In addition, some of the solutions do not follow **EXACTLY** with what she put. I did this purposefully, cause these were just for fun in the end.

### Additional Features

Start at day11-20, I implement unit tests for the code using the `unittest` module in python. This is subject to change to maybe `pytest` or `selenium` in the future. But we'll see.
